This is kind of my first "big" project using JavaScript. It is a simple weather app that fetches information 
from an API and displays it on the screen.

Overall, this project taught me how to use Javascript at an intermediate level by leveraging
the MVC pattern and restful APIs. It has helped me in my journey in front-end development, especially now that I am trying to 
learn React.

Features include:
- Change in background image to fit the time of day
- Search bar for finding a specific city's weather info

Model View Controller method was used to create this project with vanilla javascript

PLEASE NOTE (errors):
- The application takes a hot second to get started, once it loads it should work
- This app is not the most responsive but the code is clean and it was my first big project using javascript
- I will try to fix these errors and edge cases when I have time

:)
