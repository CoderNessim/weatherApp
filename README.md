This is kind of my first "big" project using javascript. It is a simple weather app that fetches information 
from an API and displays it on the screen.

Features include:
- Change in background image to fit the time of day
- Search bar for finding a specific city's weather info

Model View Controller method was used to create this project with vanilla javascript

This app is not the most responsive but the code is clean and it was my first big project using javascript
